# JSON/XML/YAML Portfolio Template
This project contains a document that serves as a **portfolio template** in `JSON`, `XML`, and `YAML` formats. The documents provide structured information about one's background, title, location, and various online profiles. Feel free to edit it and expand upon it as you see fit. 

*I will be adding more details to the documents over time such as skills, experience, education, certifications, etc.*

For an open-sourced portfolio website template, I'd suggest you checking out my repo [here](https://github.com/scottgriv/portfolio-website), which looks like [this](https://www.scottgriv.dev). Feel free to fork it and use it as you see fit!

Happy coding!

## Usage
I created this project to format my portfolio in `JSON`, `XML`, and `YAML` formats. I wanted to create a portfolio that could be used for various purposes, including configuration files, data exchange between systems, APIs, and more. 

## Definitions
`XML`, `JSON`, and `YAML` are all data serialization formats used to structure and represent data in a standardized way. They are commonly used for various purposes, including configuration files, data exchange (interchanges) between systems, APIs, and more. Here's how each format is used:

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language):
- `XML` is a markup language that uses a structured format to represent data. It consists of a set of tags that define elements and their relationships.
- `XML` is widely used for representing structured data in a human-readable and machine-readable format. It's used for configuration files, data exchange, document storage, and more.
- Applications use `XML` parsers to read and manipulate `XML` data. Common use cases include RSS feeds, configuration files (e.g., web application configuration), and document formats (e.g., Microsoft Office Open `XML`).

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
- `JSON` is a lightweight data-interchange format that uses a syntax similar to JavaScript object literals. It consists of key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects.
- `JSON` is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. It's easy for humans to read and write, and it's easy for machines to parse and generate.
- `JSON` has become the de facto standard for data exchange in modern web applications, APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs), and configuration files.

### YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language):
`YAML` is a human-readable data serialization format that uses indentation to represent data structures. It's often used for configuration files and data exchange.
`YAML` is less verbose compared to `XML` and `JSON`, making it well-suited for configuration files where readability is important.
It's commonly used in configuration files for software projects, continuous integration tools, and infrastructure as code tools like Ansible.
In summary, `XML`, `JSON`, and `YAML` are used for structuring and representing data in various applications and contexts. The choice of format depends on factors such as the use case, the technologies involved, and the preference for readability and ease of use.
